# BeastWars
Digital Bros Academy Game that I developed in 2017. Beast Wars is a turn-based strategy multiplayer local pvp game, in which two teams fight to defend a disputed kingdom.
Every team has a king to bring to the other side of the map in order to win, otherwise it has to kill the enemy king.
At the start of the game every player needs to build their team by choosing 6 units. Every unit belongs to a different class, and every class has different skills and advantages to use in the battlefield. Kill or be killed!
